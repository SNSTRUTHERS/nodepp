# Resource Management & Latency Jitter Analysis

The following logs were captured on a Dual-Core Apollo Lake Celeron during a high-concurrency stress test (1,000 cycles of 100,000 allocations).

## Memory Footprint (The "Resident Set" Gap)

The `top` command reveals a radical difference in how each runtime claims system resources.

| Runtime | Avg. Cycle Time | VIRT (Address Space) | RES (Physical RAM) | Memory Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nodepp | 3.0 ms | 6.1 MB | 2.7 MB | Deterministic RAII |
| Bun | 7.2 ms (avg) | 69.3 GB | 72.6 MB | Generational GC |
| Go | < 1.0 ms* | 703.1 MB | 2.2 MB | Concurrent GC |

> **Note:** Go's <1ms result reflects Deferred Debt, where deallocation is bypassed during the measurement window.

While Go reports low physical memory (RES), its Virtual Memory (VIRT) is 115x higher than Nodepp. In safety-critical systems, high VIRT can lead to address-space exhaustion. Bun's 69GB VIRT and 72MB RES make it unsuitable for memory-constrained embedded hardware.

## Nodepp Benchmark
> g++ -o main nodepp_benchmark.cpp -O3 ; ./main

Nodepp shows absolute stability. Every cycle takes exactly 3ms. This is the result of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), where memory is freed immediately without Stop-the-World pauses.

999 Nodepp Time: 3 ms 
1000 Nodepp Time: 3 ms (p100: 3ms)
```

## Bun Benchmark

Bun exhibits Latency Jitter. Notice how the time jumps from 5ms to 11ms. This 120% variance is caused by the Garbage Collector waking up to clean memory, which would cause stuttering in a real-time control system.

```

997 Bun Time: 6 ms

999 Bun Time: 9 ms
1000 Bun Time: 6 ms
```

## Go Benchmark

Go reports 0ms for many cycles. While this looks fast, it is a lie of omission. Go's GC is deferring the work of deallocation to a background thread. While the main task finishes quickly, the CPU is still burdened by background scavenging, which is why Go’s %CPU (77.2%) is higher than Nodepp’s (61.4%).

```

## Architectural Synthesis

The data confirms that Nodepp operates with Silicon Parity.

- **CPU Efficiency:** Nodepp achieved its results with the lowest overall CPU load per lifecycle event.

- **Reliability:** The flat 3ms line proves that Nodepp can be used for hard-deadline tasks where spikes would result in a system failure.
