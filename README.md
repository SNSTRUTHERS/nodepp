[Nodepp](https://github.com/NodeppOfficial/nodepp) is a high-performance C++ runtime designed to solve the Efficiency Paradox of modern cloud and edge computing. While traditional managed runtimes prioritize developer speed at the cost of massive hardware overhead, Nodepp provides a Vertically Integrated Architecture that achieves industry-leading throughput with a near-zero resource footprint.

This is a fork of Nodepp that aims to both adapt C++>=20 features, clean up some of the codebase, or potentially play around with adding new features.
